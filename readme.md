Maliek sent a text to Matthew saying that there was pizza in the break room.
Matthew was disheartened because he had already eaten.
A day later, Matthew sent Maliek a text stating that Krispy Kremes was downstairs.
At that point the two hit upon an idea - why not write an app that tells when there's food leftover in the break room?

When I think of the word "organization", I first think of a large organization, like a corporation.
The next usage that I think is how to organize you life, your belongings, your closet...

This application addresses two of those definitions - a large organization with leftover food after a corporate meeting.
It helps organize your lunch time.
It helps organize the corporate funds by not having any leftover waste.
